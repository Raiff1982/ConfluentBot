## ?? Key Innovations

### **Virtue Profiles**
Instead of: "0.92 probability"
Get: Compassion=0.88, Integrity=0.94, Courage=0.92, Wisdom=0.89

### **Regenerative Memory**
- Auto-snapshots stable states
- Auto-reverts to best snapshot when stressed
- Inspired by immortal jellyfish (Turritopsis dohrnii)

### **Multi-Agent Consensus**
- 5 independent agents analyze in parallel
- Each provides perspective on the data
- MetaCouncil aggregates for final decision

### **Real Fraud Detection**
- Velocity: Impossible travel detection
- Amount: Z-score anomaly detection
- Merchant: New vendor risk assessment
- History: Account-level risk scoring
